    r""" Compute the three characteristic exponents of the singular points
    of the radial Teukolsky equation.

    We want ingoing at the outer horizon and outgoing at infinity. The
    choice of one of two possible characteristic exponents at the
    inner horizon doesn't affect the minimal solution in Leaver's
    method, so we just pick one. Thus our choices are, in the
    nomenclature of [1]_, :math:`(\zeta_+, \xi_-, \eta_+)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    omega: complex
      The complex frequency in the ansatz for the solution of the
      radial Teukolsky equation.

    a: double
      Spin parameter of the black hole, 0. <= a < 1 .

    s: int

    m: int
